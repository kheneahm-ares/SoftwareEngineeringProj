<h2>CreatingMethods</h2>

A Java method is a collection of statements that are grouped together to perform an operation. <br/>
When the System.out.println() method is called, the system is executing the println() method. <br/>
<br/>
When creating a method a modifier must be specifed such as public and static. This allows everyone to use a method<br/>
without having to create an object.<br/> We also need to specify the return type, method name, and parameters if they exist. <br/>
<br/>

When method calling there are two ways in which a method is called i.e., method returns a value or returning nothing (no return value). <br/>
The process of method calling is simple. When a program invokes a method, the program control gets transferred to the called method. <br/>
This called method then returns control to the caller in two conditions, when the return statement is executed it reaches the method <br/>
ending closing brace.<br/>
In the case of a void, it returns nothing. <br/>
<br />
Methods can also be overloaded, or in other words, they can have the same name but must have diffrent parameters.<br/>
<br/>
Below are some examples of creating, calling and method overloading. <br/>
